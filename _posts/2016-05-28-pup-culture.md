[We are the Last Men if our culture is capable of producing something like this.....note the sympathetic tone of the article...](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/25/secret-life-of-the-human-pups-the-men-who-live-as-dogs?CMP=twt_gu)

They've been flooding social media with these dog stories.  Weirdly all of a sudden the too. There was just one about a man/goat, but I'm loathe to add this to my google search history to show you.  He grazed in the hills.

I've always found something particularly funny about the "furry" movement, but I can only relate to this from a Dionysian inebriated hotel bangfest (I hope there's a chick under this cat costume) kinda way.

I kid, it's fucking weird.

I find the emulation of human babies as adults particularly disturbing. Adult sized soothers, diapers, cribs, the lot.  McInnes touched briefly on this as a weird level of pedophilic tendencies.

TLC - (the misnomer of the 20th century - in both abbreviation and long form) used to devote a few episodes to "weird behaviours", but the tone these days is exceptionally forgiving, enabling.

For a society hell bent on exposing mental illness as a legitimate health concern (rightly so) , the trans-anything movement is another irreconcilable outfit in the Emperor's closet.

Notice how these articles never discuss drugs. What came first, the gay meth-head or the 'pup'?


"the main thing, says Tom, is that we see it (the pup community) at all; that we know itâ€™s there and accept it."

Ha! That's like saying: "I want the model train collector community to be recognized and accepted." Fine, enjoy your weird hobby. Now kindly fuck off and stay away from kids.

The reason why today we are reading about this stuff in mainstream newspapers is, well, explained right there in any Gay Studies course textbook or even wikipedia. Does any of this sound familiar?

Mattachine was originally organized in similar structure to the Communist Party, with cells, oaths of secrecy and five different levels of membership, each of which required greater levels of involvement and commitment. As the organization grew, the levels were expected to subdivide into new cells, creating both the potential for horizontal and vertical growth.[16] The founding members constituted the so-called "Fifth Order" and from the outset remained anonymous.

If this article was published in The Advocate, (hopefully) DJ Torquemada would never have discovered it and we wouldn't be discussing it.


If he had (for some reason) sent a link from The Advocate, we would probably crack a couple jokes and dismiss it, as we are all aware that the gay fetish scene exists, always has existed and probably always will exist. Caligula? Marquis de Sade? Aleister Crowley?


We are reacting to this because it is in a mainstream newspaper; a leftist one at that. It is being taken out of the seedy gutter and being put on display in the public forum, as if it is relevant to the average person's day-to-day existence. That is the travesty.


Why?

Fine. Here's why: incremental normalization of taboo in public perception and, inversely, the fragmentation of what the majority perceives as normality.


Propaganda. Psy-ops. The undermining of social integrity. Demoralization.


That's what communists and subversive underground movements do. The tactic doesn't just serve gays. Read the wiki link.
